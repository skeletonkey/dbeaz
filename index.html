        <h2 style="text-align:center;">We Stand for Inclusivity</h2>
        <p>Through every change in our 110+ year history, we have known one constant - our sisterhood standing hand in hand. Women of all races, nationalities, creeds, colors, faiths, and beliefs stand together here in friendship and charity. Joined by our common bond of the Commonwealth of Nations, we learn from each other and grow closer together through every struggle our world faces. It is this truth that has laid the foundation of our first century. What will you bring to our second?</p>
